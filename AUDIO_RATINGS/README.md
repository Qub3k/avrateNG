# File naming convention

The assessments recordings file naming convention is as follows:

```[user_id]_[video_id]_[YY-MM-DD]T[HH-MM-SS].webm```

datetime is based on the ISO 8601 format but hours, minutes and seconds are separated by "-" instead of ":",
because in Windows filename can not contain ":"
