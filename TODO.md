TODOS
-----
* add template folder as configarable
* move some command line flags to config file, because it is easier for windows users to configure
* add current slider value to slider template
* change styles of templates for rating so somehow optimize users perception of rating scale scheme
* speech controling of rating
* maybe add some "webcamera" recoding for eye tracking ...
    * reuse pierres ruby hackish
* integrate different rating models/approaches, e.g. MUSHRA,  DCR, SUMWIK, ACR (done)
    * some generalize which method will be used
